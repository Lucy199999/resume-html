<h1>Volunteering</h1>
<p>
    Whilst I was at Nottingham Trent Univeristy I volunteered for Emmanuel House 
    Support Centre, who support people who are homeless, sleeping rough, are 
    in crisis or are at risk of becoming homesless. I volunteered in their allotments, which not only 
    included the roles of weeding, planting and watering, but also being a friend and listening ear to our guests. 
    I also volunteered at 'The Curious Tower', a communal gardening space in Nottingham. Volunteering
    wihtin these two spaces has given me inspration on how, in the future, I could develop 
    a safe creative hub for local communities, and bring together my creativity and love of the outdoors.
