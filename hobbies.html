    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>I am an extremely active person and love being outdoors. Whilst balancing work and free time, here are some of the hobbies I enjoy:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Climbing/Bouldering
            <p>I got into climbing and bouldering in my first year at Nottingham Trent University
                and love it for the way that it tests my strength in new ways.
            </p>

        <li>Roller Skating
            <p>I had always wanted to roller skate, but had always been too afraid to start. Whilst in Nottingham, I pushed
                myself to go to adult roller skating lessons, which I absolutley loved, for the confidence it gave me,
                as well as for the friends that I made.  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Ultimate Frisbee
            <p>I have been playing Ultimate Frisbee for 5 years now, starting when I arrived at De Montfort University. I have loved being
                part of the frisbee community, which takes great pride in honesty and fair play through its rules of Spirit of the Game.
            </p>
